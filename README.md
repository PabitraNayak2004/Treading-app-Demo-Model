This project focuses on predicting stock closing prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network enhanced with sentiment analysis. Historical stock data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) was collected using the yFinance API, covering the period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2024. Simulated news headlines for selected dates were analyzed using the VADER SentimentIntensityAnalyzer to extract sentiment scores, which were then merged with the stock data based on matching dates. The combined dataset includes both numerical stock features and sentiment information. After normalization, sequences of the past 60 days were used to train the LSTM model to predict the next day's closing price. The modelâ€™s accuracy was evaluated, and predictions were visualized against actual closing prices to assess performance.
